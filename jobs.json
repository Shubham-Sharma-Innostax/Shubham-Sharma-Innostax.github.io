      "long_description": "At Jersey Shore Steel, we manufacture high-strength rail steel angles from re-rolled T-rails for a number of products. Rail steel’s high carbon content makes it stronger than many other steel products. Once reheated and re-rolled, the T-rail’s dense grain structure becomes even denser resulting in exceptional tensile and yield properties for strength and durability. This high strength-to-weight ratio provides the same performance with less material in comparison to other steel products at a heavier gauge. This yields more pieces per ton reducing material costs as well as handling and shipping costs. Jersey Shore Steel’s state-of-the-art rolling mill is a computer controlled rolling process that assures both product quality and production efficiency. Essentially, Jersey Shore Steel Company offers a higher performance product at a lower cost making Jersey Shore Steel a solid choice!",

        "long_description": "At Jersey Shore Steel, we manufacture high-strength rail steel angles from re-rolled T-rails for a number of products. Rail steel’s high carbon content makes it stronger than many other steel products. Once reheated and re-rolled, the T-rail’s dense grain structure becomes even denser resulting in exceptional tensile and yield properties for strength and durability. This high strength-to-weight ratio provides the same performance with less material in comparison to other steel products at a heavier gauge. This yields more pieces per ton reducing material costs as well as handling and shipping costs. Jersey Shore Steel’s state-of-the-art rolling mill is a computer controlled rolling process that assures both product quality and production efficiency. Essentially, Jersey Shore Steel Company offers a higher performance product at a lower cost making Jersey Shore Steel a solid choice!",

      "long_description": "Nebraska Public Power District (NPPD) electrifies the Cornhusker State. The government-owned electric utility, the largest in the state, provides power in 91 of the state's 93 counties. The firm has a generating capacity of about 3,130 MW and operates more than 5,000 miles of transmission lines. NPPD distributes electricity to about 89,000 retail customers in 80 cities and towns; it also provides power to about 1 million customers through wholesale power contracts with 52 towns and 25 public power districts. In addition, NPPD purchases electricity from the federally owned  Western Area Power Administration and operates a surface water irrigation system.\n\nFaced with growing long-term demand for electricity, along with pressure to keep prices low, NPPD has implemented plans to increase transmission capacity. With a goal of getting of 15% it energy from renewable sources by 2025, the company is exploring alternative fuel sources for future plants. With 45% of NPPD's energy supply coming from coal in 2011, the company was looking to cleaner alternatives, such as wind power and biomass in order to meet stricter environmental regulations.\n\nRetail and wholesale rate increases helped to lift the company's revenues and income in 2009, despite a recession-hit market and lower commodity prices. Retail and wholesale rate increases, and a jump in non-system sales helped to lift NPPD's overall revenues and net income in 2010, despite the ending of some power contracts it share with other power generators.\n\nTo save more than $10 million in labor costs, in 2011 NPPD offered early retirement incentives to about 360 workers.\n\nA 75% increase in coal transportation costs prompted NPPD to raise customer rates by 6% in 2012.\n\nNPPD was formed in 1970 through the merger of three public utilities: Consumers Public Power District, Platte Valley Public Power and Irrigation District, and Nebraska Public Power System.",

        "long_description": "Nebraska Public Power District (NPPD) electrifies the Cornhusker State. The government-owned electric utility, the largest in the state, provides power in 91 of the state's 93 counties. The firm has a generating capacity of about 3,130 MW and operates more than 5,000 miles of transmission lines. NPPD distributes electricity to about 89,000 retail customers in 80 cities and towns; it also provides power to about 1 million customers through wholesale power contracts with 52 towns and 25 public power districts. In addition, NPPD purchases electricity from the federally owned  Western Area Power Administration and operates a surface water irrigation system.\n\nFaced with growing long-term demand for electricity, along with pressure to keep prices low, NPPD has implemented plans to increase transmission capacity. With a goal of getting of 15% it energy from renewable sources by 2025, the company is exploring alternative fuel sources for future plants. With 45% of NPPD's energy supply coming from coal in 2011, the company was looking to cleaner alternatives, such as wind power and biomass in order to meet stricter environmental regulations.\n\nRetail and wholesale rate increases helped to lift the company's revenues and income in 2009, despite a recession-hit market and lower commodity prices. Retail and wholesale rate increases, and a jump in non-system sales helped to lift NPPD's overall revenues and net income in 2010, despite the ending of some power contracts it share with other power generators.\n\nTo save more than $10 million in labor costs, in 2011 NPPD offered early retirement incentives to about 360 workers.\n\nA 75% increase in coal transportation costs prompted NPPD to raise customer rates by 6% in 2012.\n\nNPPD was formed in 1970 through the merger of three public utilities: Consumers Public Power District, Platte Valley Public Power and Irrigation District, and Nebraska Public Power System.",
